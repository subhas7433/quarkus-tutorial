**1.1 What are Cloud-Native Applications? (1-1.5 hours)**

*   **Think of the Cloud Like a Big, Flexible Computer:** Imagine a giant computer that you can rent parts of. That's kind of what the "cloud" is. Instead of having servers in your office, you use computers on the internet.
*   **What "Cloud-Native" Means:** "Cloud-native" means building applications that are designed to run well in that cloud environment. It's like building a house that is made to be easy to move and adapt to different locations.
*   **Microservices: Building with Small Pieces:** Instead of one giant app, cloud-native often uses many small apps (called "microservices") that talk to each other. Think of it like building with LEGOs instead of one big block. Each piece does one job well.
*   **Containers: Packing Up Our Apps:** Containers (like Docker) are like lightweight boxes that hold your application and everything it needs to run. They make it easy to move your app from one place to another.
*   **Kubernetes: The Container Orchestrator:** Kubernetes is like the manager of all these containers. It makes sure they are running smoothly and working together. (We'll talk more about this later, but no need to worry too much about the details now.)
*   **Serverless: No Servers to Worry About:** Serverless is like having the cloud run your code without you having to think about the servers. You just write the code and the cloud takes care of the rest.

**Why cloud-native is important:**

*   **Speed:** Cloud-native apps can be developed and updated quickly.
*   **Scalability:** They can easily handle more users and more work.
*   **Reliability:** They are designed to handle problems without crashing completely.
*   **Flexibility:** They can easily adapt to changing needs.

**1.2 The Java Landscape in the Cloud (0.5 - 1 hour)**

*   **Java's Cloud Challenge:** Java is popular, but the traditional way to make Java apps can be slow to start up and use a lot of computer memory, which isn't ideal in the cloud.
*   **The Need for "Lighter" Java:** We need ways to make Java apps faster and smaller so they can work well in the cloud. This is where Quarkus comes in.

**1.3 Introducing Quarkus (1 - 1.5 hours)**

*   **Quarkus: The "Supersonic Subatomic Java" Framework:** Quarkus is a special tool for building Java apps that are super fast and small, making them perfect for the cloud.
*   **Main Goals of Quarkus:**
    *   **"Developer Joy":** Quarkus makes it easy and fun to build apps.
    *   **Fast Startup:** Quarkus apps start up super quickly.
    *   **Small Memory Use:** Quarkus apps don't use much memory.
    *   **Native Image:** It can make your Java app into a "native" program (like other apps on your computer) that runs even faster.
    *   **Mixing Styles:** Quarkus lets you mix regular Java programming with the reactive style (which is good for apps that need to handle a lot of data at the same time).
    *   **Made for Containers:** Quarkus apps work great in containers.
*   **Quarkus vs. Other Frameworks:** We'll see how Quarkus compares to other Java tools later in the course, but for now, just know it's a good choice for modern, cloud-native apps.

**1.4 Setting up the Development Environment (0.5 - 1 hour)**

*   **Tools We Need:**
    *   **Java:** We need Java to write Java code. (We'll check if you have it)
    *   **Maven or Gradle:** These tools help us manage our Java projects. (Choose one!)
    *   **Quarkus CLI:** We use this tool to create and work with Quarkus projects.
    *   **IDE:** This is like a fancy text editor that makes coding easier (like IntelliJ, VS Code, or Eclipse).
    *   **GraalVM:** We need this special tool for making our app into a super fast native image. (We will get to that later)
*   **Step-by-Step:** We'll go through the setup process together step by step and make sure everything works.

**1.5 Creating Your First Quarkus Project (0.5 - 1 hour)**

*   **Using the CLI or Website:** We'll use the Quarkus CLI (or the website) to make a basic project.
*   **Looking at the Project:** We'll look at what the project files look like.
*   **Running the App:** We will start the app in "development mode", which lets you change code and see the results immediately.
*   **"Hello, World!":** We'll create a simple "Hello, World!" page that you can see in your web browser.
*   **Hands-on Lab:**
    *   Create a new Quarkus project
    *   Add a simple REST endpoint to say "Hello, World!"
    *   Run the app and see the message in your browser

**Key takeaways from Module 1:**

*   Cloud-native apps are built for the cloud and are fast, scalable, and reliable.
*   Quarkus is a powerful tool for building cloud-native Java applications.
*   We'll set up our computers so we can start building with Quarkus.
*   We'll write a very simple app to get started.

**Simplified Language:**

*   Instead of "microservices," you can say "small apps."
*   Instead of "container," you can say "lightweight box."
*   Instead of "orchestration," you can say "managing."
*   Instead of "GraalVM native image," you can say "a super fast program."
