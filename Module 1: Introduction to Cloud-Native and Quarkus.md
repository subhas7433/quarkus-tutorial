**1.1 What are Cloud-Native Applications?**

Cloud-native isn't just about deploying to the cloud; it's a paradigm shift in how we design, build, deploy, and manage applications. It embraces a collection of technologies and practices that allow organizations to build and run scalable applications in dynamic environments. The key focus is on agility, resilience, and efficiency.

*   **Definition and Characteristics of Cloud-Native:**

    *   **Definition:** Cloud-native applications are designed specifically to leverage the benefits of cloud computing platforms. They are typically built as a set of independent, loosely coupled services that can be scaled and managed independently. They are also highly automated, enabling rapid changes.
    *   **Characteristics:**
        *   **Microservices Architecture:** Applications are broken down into small, independent services that perform specific business functions. This promotes modularity, flexibility, and scalability. (We'll discuss this in detail in the next point).
        *   **Containerization:** Applications and their dependencies are packaged into lightweight, portable containers (e.g., using Docker). This ensures consistent execution across different environments.
        *   **Dynamic Orchestration:** Containerized applications are often orchestrated using tools like Kubernetes. This allows for automated scaling, healing, and management of the entire application infrastructure.
        *   **DevOps Practices:** Cloud-native promotes close collaboration between development and operations teams, with a focus on automation and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD).
        *   **Elasticity and Scalability:** The ability to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand. This ensures optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
        *   **Resilience and Fault Tolerance:** Applications are designed to handle failures gracefully and automatically recover from errors.
        *   **Automation:** Automation is key throughout the application lifecycle, from building and testing to deployment and monitoring.
        *   **Observability:** The ability to monitor and understand the state of the application through logging, metrics, and tracing. This enables quicker issue identification and resolution.
        *   **API-Driven:** Communication between components is often done through well-defined APIs, making the system flexible and adaptable to change.
*   **Microservices Architecture:**

    *   **Concept:** A microservices architecture structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service focuses on a specific business function.
    *   **Contrast with Monolithic Applications:** In contrast to monolithic applications, where all code is tightly coupled, microservices are designed to be independent, allowing teams to work on different parts of the application simultaneously.
    *   **Key Principles:**
        *   **Independent Deployability:** Microservices can be deployed and updated independently without affecting other parts of the application.
        *   **Decentralized Data Management:** Each microservice can have its own data store, allowing for technology diversity and data-specific optimizations.
        *   **Loose Coupling:** Services are designed to have minimal dependencies on each other, enabling flexibility and resilience.
        *   **Single Responsibility:** Each microservice should have a clear and specific responsibility.
        *   **Technology Diversity:** Teams can choose the best technology stack for a given service, rather than being constrained by a single, monolithic stack.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Faster Time to Market:** Independent teams can work in parallel, leading to faster development and deployment cycles.
        *   **Improved Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently, allowing for efficient resource utilization.
        *   **Resilience:** Failures in one microservice don't necessarily take down the entire application.
        *   **Flexibility:** New technologies and frameworks can be adopted more easily.
    *   **Challenges:**
        *   **Complexity:** Managing a distributed system can be more complex than managing a monolithic application.
        *   **Operational Overhead:** Deploying and managing multiple services requires specialized tools and processes.
        *   **Distributed Transactions:** Managing transactions across multiple services can be challenging.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitoring and debugging a distributed system can be more complex than a monolithic application.
*   **Containers and Container Orchestration (brief overview of Kubernetes):**

    *   **Containers:**
        *   **Concept:** Containers are lightweight, stand-alone packages that bundle an application and all its dependencies (code, runtime, system libraries, settings) into a single unit.
        *   **Docker:** The most popular containerization technology, allowing developers to build, run, and share containers.
        *   **Benefits:**
            *   **Portability:** Run applications consistently across different environments.

Traditional Java, while a powerful and widely used platform, faces some challenges when it comes to modern cloud-native development.

*   **Challenges of Traditional Java in the Cloud:**

    *   **Slow Startup Times:** Traditional Java frameworks and applications often have long startup times. This can hinder elasticity in cloud environments, where quick scaling and restarts are essential. Initializing the JVM, class loading, and dependency injection often take time.
    *   **High Memory Consumption:** Traditional Java applications can consume a significant amount of memory, particularly large applications with many dependencies. This impacts resource efficiency and increases costs in the cloud.
    *   **Large Deployment Artifacts:** Deployment artifacts (JAR or WAR files) can be large, leading to longer download times and slower deployment processes.
    *   **Development Complexity:** Traditional Java frameworks can be complex to configure and use, which can slow down development cycles.
    *   **Verbose Configuration:** Managing configurations can be cumbersome, often requiring a lot of XML or complex annotation-based setups.
    *   **Not Optimized for Containers:** Traditional Java applications weren't necessarily designed with the container-first approach in mind. They often don't perform optimally in containerized environments.
    *   **Limited Support for Reactive Programming:** While traditional Java can support asynchronous processing, it often lacks the seamless integration of reactive programming paradigms, which are crucial for handling high concurrency and building responsive systems.

*   **The Need for Faster Startup Times and Smaller Memory Footprints:**

    *   **Cloud-Native Requirements:** Cloud-native applications require faster startup times and smaller memory footprints for several reasons:
        *   **Scalability and Elasticity:** Cloud platforms need to be able to quickly scale applications up or down in response to changing demand. Long startup times limit this flexibility.
        *   **Serverless Computing:** Serverless functions need to start up very quickly to handle incoming events.
        *   **Resource Efficiency:** Cloud environments typically have limited resources (CPU, memory, etc.), and applications need to be resource-efficient to reduce costs and maximize utilization.
        *   **Containerized Environments:** Small container images and quick startup times are important for optimizing container deployments and scaling them rapidly.
        *   **Cost Optimization:** Reduced memory consumption can significantly decrease cloud costs, particularly when scaling up.
        *   **Faster Deployment Cycles:** Faster startup times mean faster deployments, which translate to reduced downtime and increased agility.
    *   **Quarkus Solution:** Quarkus is designed to address these challenges by:
        *   **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:**  Quarkus uses AOT compilation at build time, including the possibility of native image compilation through GraalVM.  This enables much faster startup times.
        *   **Build-time Dependency Injection:**  Dependency injection is done during the build process rather than at runtime, which greatly improves startup times.
        *   **Zero-Configuration Approach:**  Quarkus provides intelligent defaults to minimize boilerplate and configuration.
        *   **Optimized Memory Usage:**  By performing as much work at build time as possible, Quarkus can dramatically reduce the memory footprint.
        *   **Container-first design:** It's designed for containers, ensuring optimal performance within that context.
        *   **Reactive Programming:** It provides tight integration with the Mutiny reactive library to build responsive and scalable applications.

    *   **Installation (Recommended):** The Quarkus CLI provides a convenient way to create projects, manage extensions, run in development mode, and build applications.
        *   **SDKMAN! (Recommended):**
            *   `sdk install quarkus`
            *   This installs the latest stable Quarkus CLI version.
        *   **Homebrew (macOS):**
            *   `brew install quarkus-cli`
        *   **Manual Installation (or other methods):** Refer to the official Quarkus installation guide for more options: [https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling](https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling)
    *   **Verification:**
        *   Run `quarkus --version` to verify the installation.
    *   **Usage:**
        *   `quarkus create app` : Creates a new project.
        *   `quarkus ext ls`: Lists available extensions.
        *   `quarkus ext add <extension-name>`: Adds an extension to your project.
        *   `quarkus dev`: Runs the application in development mode (with live coding).
        *   `quarkus build`: Builds the application.
        *   `quarkus build --native`: Build the application to a native executable.

*   **Code Generator (code.quarkus.io):**
    *   **Website:** Go to [https://code.quarkus.io/](https://code.quarkus.io/).
    *   **Web-Based Project Creation:**
        *   Select your build tool (Maven or Gradle).
        *   Enter your project's group ID, artifact ID, and version.
        *   Choose your desired extensions (you can search for them).
        *   Click "Generate your application".
        *   Download the generated ZIP file.
        *   Extract the ZIP file to your desired project location.
    *   **Advantages:**
        *   Easy to use, especially for beginners.
        *   Provides a visual way to select extensions.
    *   **Disadvantages:**
        *   Less control compared to the CLI.
        *   Might not always have the very latest Quarkus versions or extensions.

**1.4.4 Choosing an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse)**

You can use any text editor to write Quarkus code, but an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) provides many features that enhance productivity. Here are some popular choices:

*   **IntelliJ IDEA:**
    *   **Excellent Quarkus Support:** IntelliJ IDEA has superb built-in support for Quarkus, including code completion, debugging, running in development mode, and managing extensions.
    *   **Ultimate Edition (Paid):** Offers the best Quarkus integration.
    *   **Community Edition (Free):** Provides basic support but might lack some advanced features.
    *   **Installation:** Download from the JetBrains website: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

*   **VS Code:**
    *   **Quarkus Extension:** VS Code requires the "Quarkus" extension from the VS Code Marketplace for Quarkus support.
    *   **Lightweight and Fast:** VS Code is known for being lightweight and fast.
    *   **Growing Quarkus Support:** The Quarkus extension is continuously improving.
    *   **Installation:** Download from the VS Code website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    *   **Install the Extension:** Search for "Quarkus" in the Extensions Marketplace and install it.

*   **Eclipse:**
    *   **Quarkus Tools:** Eclipse requires the "Quarkus Tools" plugin for Quarkus support.
    *   **Mature IDE:** Eclipse is a mature and widely used IDE.
    *   **Installation:** Download from the Eclipse website: [https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
    *   **Install the Plugin:** Use the Eclipse Marketplace to install "Quarkus Tools".

*   **Other IDEs:**
    *   **NetBeans:** Has basic Quarkus support, and the community is working to enhance it.
    *   **Vim/Emacs:** You can use these text editors with appropriate language server protocol (LSP) clients for code completion and other features.

**1.4.5 Installing GraalVM (for native image compilation)**

GraalVM is required if you want to build native executables of your Quarkus applications.

*   **Download GraalVM:**
    *   **GraalVM Community Edition (CE):**
        *   Go to the GraalVM CE downloads page: [https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/)
        *   Download the appropriate distribution for your operating system and Java version (e.g., Java 17).
        *   Make sure you download the **native-image** package.
    *   **GraalVM Enterprise Edition (EE):**
        *   Available from Oracle (requires an Oracle account). Offers additional performance optimizations.
*   **Installation:**
    *   Extract the downloaded archive to a suitable location.
*   **Set Environment Variables:**
    *   **`GRAALVM_HOME`:** Set this variable to the root directory of your GraalVM installation.
    *   **`JAVA_HOME`:** (Optional, but recommended) Set this variable to the same GraalVM installation directory so that your default Java is GraalVM.
    *   **`PATH`:** Add the `bin` directory of your GraalVM installation to your `PATH`. Also make sure, that `PATH` has the graalvm `bin` directory before any other Java `bin` directory. This ensures that the `native-image` utility is available.
*   **Install Native Image (if not included):**
    *   If your GraalVM distribution didn't come with `native-image` pre-installed, you need to install it:
        *   `$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/gu install native-image`
*   **Verification:**
    *   Run `$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/java -version` to ensure you're using GraalVM's Java.
    *   Run `$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --version` to verify that `native-image` is installed correctly.
*   **Using with Maven or Gradle:**
    *   When building native images with Quarkus (e.g., `quarkus build --native`), Quarkus will automatically use the `native-image` tool from your `GRAALVM_HOME` if it's set correctly.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **System Requirements:** Building native images can be resource-intensive (especially RAM). Make sure your system meets the recommended requirements for GraalVM.
*   **Troubleshooting:** If you encounter issues with native image compilation, consult the GraalVM and Quarkus documentation for troubleshooting tips.
*   **Development vs. Production:** You might want to use a regular JDK during development (for faster build times) and only use GraalVM for building native images for production deployments. Using a java version manager makes this easy.

By following these steps, you'll have a fully functional Quarkus development environment ready for building, testing, and deploying your applications! Remember to consult the official documentation for each tool if you encounter any issues or need more detailed instructions.


**1.5 Creating Your First Quarkus Project**

This section will guide you through the process of creating your first Quarkus project, explaining the project structure, how to run the application in development mode, and the basic configuration files involved.

**1.5.1 Generating a Project Using the CLI or Code Generator**

You have two main options for generating a new Quarkus project:

*   **a) Quarkus CLI (Command Line Interface):**

    *   **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
    *   **Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.**
    *   **Use the `quarkus create app` command:**
        *   **Example (Maven):**
            ```bash
            quarkus create app org.acme:my-quarkus-project --maven
            ```
            This creates a new Maven project with the following:
            *   `org.acme`: The group ID.
            *   `my-quarkus-project`: The artifact ID.
        *   **Example (Gradle):**
            ```bash
            quarkus create app org.acme:my-quarkus-project --gradle
            ```
            This creates a new Gradle project.
        *   **Adding Extensions:**
            *   You can add extensions during project creation using the `--extension` or `-x` flag. For example:
            ```bash
            quarkus create app org.acme:my-quarkus-project -x=resteasy-reactive,jackson
            ```
            This adds the `resteasy-reactive` extension, which provides JAX-RS support to handle REST requests, and `resteasy-reactive-jackson`, which enables JSON serialization/deserialization via Jackson.
    *   **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
        *   Once the project is created, navigate into the project directory:
            ```bash
            cd my-quarkus-project
            ```

*   **b) Code Generator (code.quarkus.io):**

    *   **Open your web browser and go to [https://code.quarkus.io/](https://code.quarkus.io/).**
    *   **Fill in Project Details:**
        *   **Group:** Enter your project's group ID (e.g., `org.acme`).
        *   **Artifact:** Enter your project's artifact ID (e.g., `my-quarkus-project`).
        *   **Build Tool:** Select Maven or Gradle.
        *   **Extensions:** Search for and select the extensions you need. For a basic REST project, you'll likely need `RESTEasy Reactive` and probably `RESTEasy Reactive Jackson`.
    *   **Generate and Download:**
        *   Click the "Generate your application" button.
        *   Download the generated ZIP file.
    *   **Extract:**
        *   Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your desired project location.
    *   **Open the project in your IDE**

**1.5.2 Project Structure Overview**

A typical Quarkus project (whether generated with the CLI or the code generator) has the following structure:

```
my-quarkus-project/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/                 # Your application's Java source code
│   │   │   └── org/
│   │   │       └── acme/
│   │   │           └── GreetingResource.java  # Example REST resource (will be created)
│   │   └── resources/            # Application configuration and static resources
│   │       ├── META-INF/
│   │       │   └── resources/    # Static resources accessible from the web (HTML, CSS, JS)
│   │       │       └── index.html  # Example static web page
│   │       └── application.properties   # Main application configuration file
│   └── test/                     # Your test code
│       └── java/
│           └── org/
│               └── acme/
│                   └── GreetingResourceTest.java # Example test
├── target/                     # Build output directory (Maven)
├── build/                      # Build output directory (Gradle)
├── pom.xml                     # Maven project configuration file
├── build.gradle                # Gradle build script
├── .gitignore                  # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
├── README.md                   # Project README file
└── mvnw/gradlew                # Maven/Gradle wrapper scripts
```

**Key Directories and Files:**

*   **`src/main/java`:** Contains your application's Java source code.
*   **`src/main/resources`:**
    *   **`META-INF/resources`:** Holds static resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) that will be served by the application.
    *   **`application.properties`:** The main configuration file for your Quarkus application. You'll use this to configure various aspects of your application, such as database connections, server port, and extension settings.
*   **`src/test/java`:** Contains your test code (e.g., JUnit tests).
*   **`pom.xml` (Maven):** The Project Object Model (POM) file. It defines project dependencies, build settings, and other project metadata.
*   **`build.gradle` (Gradle):** The Gradle build script. Similar to `pom.xml`, it defines project dependencies, build settings, and other project metadata.
*   **`mvnw`/`gradlew`:** Maven and Gradle wrapper scripts. These allow you to build your project even if you don't have Maven or Gradle installed globally on your system.

**1.5.3 Running the Application in Development Mode (Live Coding)**

Quarkus's development mode (live coding) is one of its most powerful features. It allows you to make changes to your code and see the results immediately without restarting the application.

*   **Starting Development Mode:**
    *   **Using the Quarkus CLI:**
        *   Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
        *   Run:
            ```bash
            ./mvnw quarkus:dev  # For Maven
            ```
            ```bash
            ./gradlew quarkusDev  # For Gradle
            ```
    *   **From your IDE:**
        *   Most IDEs with Quarkus support allow you to start development mode directly from the IDE (e.g., using a run configuration or a dedicated Quarkus tool window). Refer to your IDE's documentation for specific instructions.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   Quarkus monitors your project files for changes.
    *   When you save a change (e.g., to a Java file or a configuration file), Quarkus automatically recompiles the affected code and hot-reloads it into the running application.
    *   You can immediately see the changes reflected in your application without a manual restart.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Faster Development:** Significantly speeds up the development feedback loop.
    *   **Increased Productivity:** Reduces the time spent waiting for application restarts.
    *   **Easier Debugging:** Makes it easier to experiment and debug code changes.
*   **Live coding also works for static resources**
    *   When you save for example an `index.html` file, you can see the results immediately in your browser.

**1.5.4 Basic `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` Configuration**

*   **`pom.xml` (Maven):**

    ```xml

    **Key Elements:**

    *   **`<dependencies>`:**
        *   Lists the project's dependencies (libraries that your project uses).
        *   The most important dependency is the `quarkus-bom` (Bill of Materials), which manages the versions of all Quarkus-related dependencies. You don't need to specify the version for each Quarkus dependency if it's included in the BOM.
        *   Dependencies for extensions you've added (e.g., `quarkus-resteasy-reactive`, `quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jackson`).
    *   **`<build>`:**
        *   Contains build-related plugins and configurations.
        *   **`quarkus-maven-plugin`:** The Quarkus Maven plugin, responsible for building the Quarkus application, running development mode, and other tasks.
        *   **`maven-compiler-plugin`:** Configures the Java compiler (e.g., sets the Java version).
        *   **`maven-surefire-plugin`:** Used for running tests.
    *   **`<profiles>`:**
        *   Defines different build profiles (e.g., `native` profile for native image builds).

*   **`build.gradle` (Gradle):**

    ```gradle
    plugins {
        id 'java'
        id 'io.quarkus'
    }

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        mavenLocal()
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation enforcedPlatform("${quarkusPlatformGroupId}:${quarkusPlatformArtifactId}:${quarkusPlatformVersion}") // Quarkus BOM
        implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive'
        implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jackson'
        implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-arc'
        testImplementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-junit5'
        testImplementation 'io.rest-assured:rest-assured'
    }

    group 'org.acme'
    version '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'

    java {
        sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
        targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    }

    test {
        systemProperty "java.util.logging.manager", "org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager"
    }
    compileJava {
        options.encoding = 'UTF-8'
        options.compilerArgs << '-parameters'
    }

    compileTestJava {
        options.encoding = 'UTF-8'
    }
    ```

    **Key Elements:**

    *   **`plugins`:**
        *   Applies the `java` plugin (for Java support) and the `io.quarkus` plugin (for Quarkus support).
    *   **`repositories`:**
        *   Specifies where to download dependencies (usually `mavenCentral()`).
    *   **`dependencies`:**
        *   Lists project dependencies.
        *   `enforcedPlatform(...)` imports the Quarkus BOM.
        *   Dependencies for extensions (e.g., `quarkus-resteasy-reactive`).
    *   **`group`, `version`:**
        *   Define the project's group ID and version.
    *   **`java`:**
        *   Configures Java compilation (e.g., sets the source and target compatibility).
    *   **`test`:**
        *   Configures test execution.

**1.5.5 Hands-on Lab: Create a Simple "Hello, World!" REST Endpoint and Test It**

Now, let's create a basic REST endpoint that returns "Hello, World!" and see how live coding works:

1. **Create `GreetingResource.java`:**
    *   If you used the CLI with the `resteasy-reactive` extension or selected it on the code generator website, you should already have a file named `GreetingResource.java` (or similar) in the `src/main/java/<your-package>` directory.
    *   If not, create a new Java class named `GreetingResource` in the `src/main/java/org/acme` (or your package) directory.

2. **Add the following code to `GreetingResource.java`:**

    ```java
    package org.acme;

    import jakarta.ws.rs.GET;
    import jakarta.ws.rs.Path;
    import jakarta.ws.rs.Produces;
    import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

    @Path("/hello")
    public class GreetingResource {

        @GET
        @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
        public String hello() {
            return "Hello, World from Quarkus!";
        }
    }
    ```

    **Explanation:**

    *   **`@Path("/hello")`:**  This annotation specifies that this class will handle requests to the `/hello` path.
    *   **`@GET`:** This annotation indicates that the `hello()` method will handle HTTP GET requests.
    *   **`@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)`:** This annotation specifies that the method will return a plain text response.
    *   **`public String hello()`:** This is the method that will be executed when a GET request is made to `/hello`. It simply returns the string "Hello, World from Quarkus!".

3. **Start Development Mode:**

    *   If it's not already running, start Quarkus in development mode:
        ```bash
        ./mvnw quarkus:dev  # Maven
        ```
        ```bash
        ./gradlew quarkusDev  # Gradle
        ```

4. **Test the Endpoint:**

    *   Open your web browser or use a tool like `curl` to access the following URL:
        ```
        http://localhost:8080/hello
        ```
        You should see the response:
        ```
        Hello, World from Quarkus!
        ```

5. **Live Coding in Action:**

    *   **Modify the `hello()` method:** While the application is still running in development mode, go back to `GreetingResource.java` and change the return value of the `hello()` method:
        ```java
        return "Hello from Quarkus! Live coding in action!";
        ```
    *   **Save the file.**
    *   **Refresh your browser or send the request with `curl` again.** You should immediately see the updated response without having to restart the application:
        ```
        Hello from Quarkus! Live coding in action!
        ```

6. **`GreetingResourceTest.java`:**
    *   There is a file `GreetingResourceTest.java` in the `src/test/java/<your-package>` directory. The content of the file is

        ```java
        package org.acme;

        import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
        import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

        import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;
        import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.is;

        @QuarkusTest
        public class GreetingResourceTest {

            @Test
            public void testHelloEndpoint() {
                given()
                  .when().get("/hello")
                  .then()
                     .statusCode(200)
                     .body(is("Hello from Quarkus! Live coding in action!"));
            }

        }
        ```

     *  **Explanation:**
        *   `@QuarkusTest` This annotation tells JUnit to run the test with Quarkus
        *   `testHelloEndpoint()` This is the method that contains our test.
        *   `given()` Starts building the request specification.
        *   `.when().get("/hello")` Specifies that an HTTP GET request should be made to the /hello endpoint.
        *   `.then()` Starts building the response validation assertions.
        *   `.statusCode(200)` Asserts that the HTTP status code of the response should be 200 (OK).
        *   `.body(is("Hello from Quarkus! Live coding in action!"))` Asserts that the response body should be equal to "Hello from Quarkus! Live coding in action!".

     * **Run the test:**
        * You can run the test from your IDE.
        * To run the test from command line use
             ```bash
             ./mvnw test # Maven
             ```
            ```bash
             ./gradlew test # Gradle
             ```

**Congratulations!** You've now created your first Quarkus project, understood its basic structure, experienced the magic of live coding, and tested your first REST endpoint. This foundation will be crucial as you explore more advanced Quarkus features in the following modules.
